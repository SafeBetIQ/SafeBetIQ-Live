## Identifying Money Laundering in Daily Operations

This lesson provides detailed guidance on recognizing money laundering attempts in your daily work. Effective detection requires understanding typologies, recognizing patterns, and trusting professional judgment.

## Casino-Specific Money Laundering Typologies

### Typology 1: The Quick Flip

**Method:**
Criminal purchases large amount of chips with cash, plays briefly, cashes out via different payment method.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Arrives with R100,000-R500,000 cash
2. Purchases chips at cashier or cage
3. Moves to gaming floor
4. Plays minimal amount (R5,000-R15,000)
5. Returns to cage within 1-2 hours
6. Requests payout via cheque or wire transfer
7. Leaves immediately

**Red Flags:**
- Large cash buy-in
- Very short gaming session
- Minimal actual gambling observed
- Different payout method requested
- Appears uninterested in games
- Focus on completing transaction

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Classic placement and layering

**Your Response:**
- Document time between buy-in and cash-out
- Note actual play observed
- Calculate play-to-buy-in ratio
- Question reason for payout method change
- File STR if pattern clear

**Real Example:**
*Customer "John" purchased R250,000 in chips at 14:30 with cash. Played blackjack for 45 minutes, wagered approximately R10,000 total. At 15:30 requested cash-out of R242,000 via bank transfer. When questioned about source of cash, became defensive and agitated. STR filed.*

### Typology 2: The Group Operation

**Method:**
Multiple people working together to structure transactions below reporting threshold.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. 5-10 people arrive together (or coordinated timing)
2. Each purchases chips in amount just under R25,000
3. Aggregate transactions total R200,000-R500,000
4. Minimal gambling by all members
5. Regroup and combine chips
6. One person cashes out large amount
7. Group leaves together

**Red Flags:**
- Multiple people arriving together
- Similar transaction amounts (R20,000-R24,000)
- Coordinated timing
- Limited communication with staff
- Similar demographics or appearance
- Minimal gambling by all
- Chip consolidation observed
- Group departure

**Risk Level:** VERY HIGH - Structured placement operation

**Your Response:**
- Treat group as single customer for reporting
- Aggregate transactions even if individually below threshold
- Document group dynamics and coordination
- Note any communication or direction between members
- Question relationships if appropriate
- File STR immediately

**Real Example:**
*Seven individuals arrived 15 minutes apart. Each purchased exactly R24,000 in chips. All played same slot machines briefly, minimal wagering. Observed consolidating chips in restroom area. One member cashed out R162,000 via cheque. Surveillance footage confirmed coordination. Group arrested for drug trafficking money laundering.*

### Typology 3: The Losing Scheme

**Method:**
Criminals deliberately lose to confederates to transfer value.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Criminal A has dirty money to launder
2. Criminal B is confederate (accomplice)
3. Criminal A purchases chips with dirty cash
4. Both sit at same table game
5. Criminal A deliberately loses to Criminal B
6. Criminal B leaves with winnings
7. Criminal B cashes out - money appears as gambling winnings

**Red Flags:**
- Player making obviously poor decisions
- No reaction to losing
- Excessive losses without concern
- Another player winning consistently against them
- Players arriving/leaving together
- Communication between players
- One player coaching another
- Unusual betting patterns

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Layering through deliberate loss

**Your Response:**
- Gaming staff monitor play patterns
- Note relationship between players
- Document unusual betting or playing
- Question chip transfers at tables
- Report suspicious losses to pit boss
- File STR if pattern evident

**Real Example:**
*Two blackjack players observed over 3 hours. Player A made consistently illogical plays, lost R180,000 to Player B. Player B won R165,000. Both left together. Surveillance review showed they arrived together and communicated frequently. STR filed, investigation revealed organized crime connection.*

### Typology 4: The False Win Claim

**Method:**
Criminal claims casino winnings as source of funds for large purchase.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Criminal launders money through casino (minimal play)
2. Obtains casino cheque or wire transfer
3. Deposits in bank account
4. Bank questions source of funds
5. Criminal provides casino payout as "proof"
6. Uses funds to purchase property, vehicles, business

**Red Flags:**
- Requests for detailed payout documentation
- Asking for win/loss statements
- Large payouts not proportional to observed play
- Player specifically mentions needing documentation
- Recent customer with large payout
- Multiple casinos involved in short time

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Integration stage

**Your Response:**
- Question unusual documentation requests
- Verify play history before providing win/loss statements
- Note if payout seems disproportionate to play
- Coordinate with player tracking systems
- Be cautious of accommodating unusual requests
- File STR if circumstances suspicious

**Real Example:**
*Customer requested detailed win/loss statement for "tax purposes" after R300,000 payout. Review of play showed only R50,000 wagered total. Customer had visited 4 casinos in 2 weeks, all with similar patterns. Investigation revealed customer was using false winnings claims to deposit proceeds from corruption scheme.*

### Typology 5: The Third-Party Payment

**Method:**
Using intermediaries to disguise source of funds.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Criminal cannot use own identity (wanted, sanctioned, etc.)
2. Recruits nominee (often desperate person needing money)
3. Nominee conducts casino transactions using criminal''s money
4. Nominee provides ID and information
5. Criminal directs all actions behind scenes
6. Nominee receives small fee
7. Criminal receives cleaned funds

**Red Flags:**
- Customer seems to be acting on behalf of another
- Receives phone calls during transactions with instructions
- Unclear about source of funds
- Income/lifestyle doesn''t match transaction size
- Nervous or coached responses
- References "my boss" or "friend"
- Someone else visible nearby directing

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Identity concealment

**Your Response:**
- Question who beneficial owner of funds is
- Ask about relationship to source of money
- Document suspicious third-party indicators
- Refuse transaction if nominee status clear
- Report to supervisor immediately
- File STR

**Real Example:**
*Young unemployed woman attempted R150,000 cash purchase. When questioned, repeatedly looked at older man across casino floor, made phone calls before answering questions. Eventually admitted "helping a friend." Transaction declined, STR filed. Investigation revealed "friend" was sanctioned individual on OFAC list.*

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Red Flag Recognition

Review each scenario and identify red flags:

**Scenario A:**
Customer arrives with R400,000 cash in rubber-banded bundles of R50 notes. Appears nervous, repeatedly asks about reporting requirements. Purchases chips at 4 different cage windows in R95,000 increments over 2 hours. Plays R10,000 at blackjack. Requests wire transfer payout. When asked about source of cash, says "I sold my car."

**Red Flags:**
- Very large cash amount
- Small denominations bundled
- Nervousness
- Asking about reporting (unusual)
- Structuring across multiple windows
- Minimal gambling
- Different payout method
- Implausible source explanation (car sale would be bank transfer/cheque typically)

**Assessment:** VERY HIGH RISK - Strong STR

**Scenario B:**
Regular VIP customer, known for 3 years, consistently plays R50,000-R100,000 per visit monthly. Tonight plays R75,000 blackjack session, loses R12,000. Requests standard cheque payout of R63,000. Friendly and relaxed.

**Red Flags:**
- None significant - consistent with established pattern

**Assessment:** LOW RISK - Normal monitoring

### Exercise 2: Risk Scoring

Calculate risk score:

Customer Profile:
- Business owner from Mozambique (+2 - cross-border)
- Cash-intensive business (forex bureau) (+2)
- New customer (+1)

Transaction:
- R180,000 cash purchase (+2 - large amount)
- Played R15,000 over 45 minutes (+2 - minimal gambling)
- Requested cheque payout (+2 - different method)

Behavior:
- Became defensive when asked about business (+2)
- Vague about source of cash (+1)

**Total Score: 14 points = VERY HIGH RISK**

**Action:** Supervisor involvement, detailed questioning, strong STR consideration

## Documentation Best Practices

**Effective STR Documentation:**

**WHO:**
- Full name, ID number, contact details
- Physical description
- Associates involved
- Beneficial owners if entity

**WHAT:**
- Specific transactions (amounts, dates, times)
- Gaming activity observed
- Payout requests
- Documentation provided

**WHEN:**
- Timeline of events
- Duration of activities
- Pattern over time

**WHERE:**
- Casino locations used
- Geographic connections
- High-risk jurisdictions

**WHY:**
- Specific red flags identified
- Inconsistencies noted
- Concerns articulated
- Risk assessment reasoning

**HOW:**
- Method of laundering suspected
- Techniques observed
- Associates involved

**Example Documentation:**

*"Customer Jane Doe (ID: 7505134567089) conducted 4 separate chip purchases on 2024-06-15 between 14:00-18:00, totaling R380,000 cash. Transactions were R92,000, R95,000, R94,000, and R99,000 - all just below R100,000 threshold. Customer appeared nervous, asked multiple questions about reporting requirements, stated she preferred transactions "kept private." Gaming surveillance showed only R18,000 wagered during 4-hour period across slot machines. At 18:30 requested wire transfer payout of R358,000 to offshore account in Mauritius. When asked about source of cash, stated "savings" but could not provide details. Occupation listed as "unemployed" on ID verification form. Assessment: Structuring combined with minimal gambling, offshore payout, and implausible source indicate money laundering. RISK SCORE: 16. STR RECOMMENDED."*

## Continuous Vigilance

**Remember:**
- Money launderers are professional and sophisticated
- Methods constantly evolve
- No single indicator is definitive
- Patterns over time are significant
