## Professional Training for Financial Crime Prevention

Welcome to this essential training on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) for casino professionals. This module provides comprehensive knowledge of how casinos are used in money laundering schemes and your critical role in preventing financial crime.

## Why AML Training Is Critical

Casinos process billions of rand annually, making them attractive targets for criminals seeking to launder proceeds from serious crimes including drug trafficking, human trafficking, corruption, terrorism financing, and organized crime.

### The Scale of the Problem

**Global Money Laundering:**
- Estimated 2-5% of global GDP ($800 billion - $2 trillion annually)
- Casinos identified as high-risk sector by FATF
- South Africa designated as higher-risk jurisdiction

**Impact on Society:**
- Funds terrorism and organized crime
- Undermines legitimate economy
- Corrupts financial institutions
- Facilitates drug trade and human trafficking
- Destabilizes governments and communities

**Casino Industry Vulnerability:**
- Large cash transactions common
- Anonymous gambling possible
- Rapid movement of funds
- International player base
- Multiple transaction types
- Entertainment environment masks criminal activity

## Legal Framework in South Africa

## What Is Money Laundering?

**Definition:** The process of making illegally-obtained money ("dirty money") appear legitimate ("clean").

### The Three Stages of Money Laundering

**Stage 1: PLACEMENT**

**Definition:** Introducing illegal funds into the financial system.

**Casino Methods:**
- Purchasing chips with cash
- Buying into high-stakes games
- Making large cash deposits
- Using currency exchange services
- Purchasing casino cheques

**Example:**
*Drug trafficker arrives with R500,000 cash in duffel bag. Purchases chips over several days in R24,000 transactions (below reporting threshold). Now the criminal has "placed" dirty cash into the financial system.*

**Red Flags:**
- Large amounts of cash from unknown sources
- Reluctance to provide identification
- Nervousness during large cash transaction
- Arriving with others who also conduct cash transactions
- Structured transactions just below reporting thresholds

**Stage 2: LAYERING**

**Definition:** Separating illegal proceeds from their source through complex layers of financial transactions.

**Casino Methods:**
- Minimal gambling followed by cashing out
- Moving funds between different games/tables
- Using multiple player accounts
- Transferring chips to other players
- Losing deliberately to confederates
- Requesting frequent payment methods changes

**Example:**
*Money launderer purchases R100,000 in chips, plays a few hands of blackjack (losing R5,000), then cashes out R95,000 via casino cheque. Now the money appears to be gambling winnings, not crime proceeds.*

**Red Flags:**
- Little to no actual gambling
- Requesting different payout method than deposit
- Frequent small bets followed by large cash-out
- Elaborate chip transactions with minimal play
- Moving money between multiple accounts rapidly

**Stage 3: INTEGRATION**

**Definition:** Returning laundered funds to criminal as legitimate wealth.

**Casino Methods:**
- Claiming money as gambling winnings
- Using casino cheques to purchase assets
- Wire transferring to overseas accounts
- Obtaining tax documentation for "winnings"
- Investing in legitimate businesses

**Example:**
*After multiple cycles of placement and layering through several casinos, criminal has R5 million in casino cheques and wire transfers appearing to be gambling winnings. Deposits into bank account, buys property, invests in business - now appears to be legitimate wealthy gambler.*

**Red Flags:**
- Large payouts with minimal play history
- Requesting tax documentation for suspicious wins
- Multiple casinos involved in short timeframe
- Winnings not proportional to play observed
- Immediate investment of casino proceeds

## Common Money Laundering Methods in Casinos

### Method 1: Structuring (Smurfing)

**Description:** Breaking large amounts into smaller transactions below reporting thresholds (R24,999.99).

**How It Works:**
- Criminal has R500,000 to launder
- Recruits 20 "smurfs" (accomplices)
- Each makes R24,000 purchase (below R25,000 threshold)
- Repeat over several days
- Aggregate transactions avoid detection

**Indicators:**
- Multiple people arriving together
- Similar transaction amounts just below threshold
- Coordinated timing
- Minimal gambling after purchase
- Same addresses or identification patterns

**Your Response:**
- Aggregate transactions from related parties
- Report suspicious patterns even if individual transactions below threshold
- Document group behaviors
- File STR if structuring suspected

### Method 2: Minimal Gambling

**Description:** Purchase chips, gamble minimally, cash out in different form.

**How It Works:**
- Purchase R100,000 chips with cash
- Play R5,000-R10,000 (small loss acceptable)
- Cash out via cheque or wire transfer
- Money now appears to be gambling proceeds

**Indicators:**
- Large cash purchase followed by minimal play

### Method 3: Chip Walking

**Your Response:**

### Ethical Dilemmas

**Scenario: VIP Customer**
Your best VIP customer, who generates significant revenue, exhibits concerning patterns. Reporting might lose the business.

**Right Action:** Report. Revenue never justifies enabling crime.

**Scenario: Colleague Involved**
You suspect a colleague is facilitating money laundering.

**Right Action:** Report to AML officer or compliance. Loyalty to law supersedes personal relationships.

**Scenario: Pressure from Management**
Manager suggests not reporting borderline case to avoid regulatory attention.
